# Machine-Learning
Short Machine Learning in Jupyter notebok

Algorithms are arranged based on @amueller [notebook](https://github.com/amueller/introduction_to_ml_with_python).

## Regression
A fuel consumption dataset which contains model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada, taken from [Cognitive Class lab activity](https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/ML0101ENv3/labs/FuelConsumptionCo2.csv)

## Classification
The customer dataset focuses on using demographic data, such as region, age, and marital, to predict usage patterns, taken from [Cognitive Class lab activity](https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/ML0101ENv3/labs/teleCust1000t.csv).
The target field, called custcat, has four possible values that correspond to the four customer groups, as follows: 1- Basic Service 2- E-Service 3- Plus Service 4- Total Service
